      p A hash is not ‘encryption’ – it cannot be decrypted back to the original text (it is a ‘one-way’ cryptographic function, and is a fixed size for any size of source text). This makes it suitable when it is appropriate to compare ‘hashed’ versions of texts, as opposed to decrypting the text to obtain the original version.
      br
      p A good hash function/algorithm that can be used in cryptography has the following properties:
      ul
        li Defined range: No matter how long the input is, the output is always of the same length
        li Determinism: For the same input, the output will always be identical
        li Non-invertible: From the output you can not calculate or guess the input
        li Uniformity: Small changes in the input lead to significant changes in the output
            
      p Here we use SHA256 (also called SHA-256, short for Secure Hash Algorithm 2, 256 bit) because it is the same hash algorithm that is currently used for the Bitcoin network.<brThe output is always 256bit long which is 64 characters when encoded hexadecimally.

      p A block is the smallest unit of a block chain.
      p For our project we have 5 elements :
      ul
        li Block number: The Number of the block in the chain. Integer that starts at 1 and is increased by one for every new block.
        li Nonce: A number that is used to make a block valid. Its sole purpose is to be adjusted until the hash of the whole block has certain properties that make it "valid".
        li  Data: The actual data of the block. Can be anything!
        li Previous block hash: The hash of the previous block. For the first block in a chain an arbitrary value like 00000000000... is used (something that is very unlikely to be a real hash).
        li Hash: All previous elements appended together and then hashed. For our example the hash is calculated with the following code: CryptoJS.SHA256([blockNumber, nonce, data, prev].join(''))
